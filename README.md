Project elements:

    -Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create a number of folders
    -List the folders in a tree-like structure
    -Use the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence
    -Create and execute a JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug

**p2**
Project elements:

    -Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
    -Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
    -Use git via VSCode
        -Create and use a .gitignore file
        -Diff split screen

creating the "Ultimate Coin Tool" web application with two basic capabilities:

    -Calculating all possible US coin combinations given a specific target number of pennies
    -Calculating the value in pennies of a specific number of each of the available US coins.

This project consists of the following phases:
    -setup
    -create ans test code module
    -create an express REST API server that importats and uses the code module
    -update web server to include a web page for REST API interaction
    -add a .gitignore file for Github
**p4**
This project consists of:
    -creating a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. You will create all of the code to work with the data source using a code module, and test the code module code using provided testing code. You will also create a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb.

This project consists of:
    -creating some type of a game using a JavaScript class, a web server, a client program, and separate code modules. What game you choose to create is entirely up to you, so long as your final product meets the project requirements. You can use AI to assist with this project, and how much is up to you. 

The point of my video game is to be able to battle a monster that gets randomly generated with each monster having different levels of health and having the player be able to choose between different weapons that do different ranges of damage. The player has to be careful because the monster that gets randomly generated can attack them too, so depending on what monster they get, and what weapon they choose will determine if they will lose or win the game.

create a client-server web application of your choice that satisfies the project requirements.

The way this code is constructed is meant to test out how to use server with public folders like index, script, and style. By doing this I build code inside of the server that has GET, POST, PUT and DELETE which communicates with the public files that let me decorate and construct the website into whatever I want. I did this by allowing the user to add or unadd any words they please into an item object that gets displayed. The way the code is meant to work is you put whatever word you want displayed into the white box, and then once you click the button it will be pushed to output the word that got entered. After that, you will see the word is now underneath the title “History List” which now the client can decide to either keep the word displayed, delete it or keep adding more words to the list.
